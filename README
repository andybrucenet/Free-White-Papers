Free White Papers!
------------------
Last updated: 11 NOV 2010, ABr

Many times you will find white papers available online on
security topics -- only to discover that the provider
wants to get all sorts of info from you. Then you read the
white paper and discover it was written by a third-party 
vendor who wants *everybody* to see, read, and respond to
the information (just because a vendor writes a white paper
doesn't make it suspect).

My aim here is to provide these opensource and non-restricted
white papers on security topics for free here. Free as in
"free beer;" no need to give me anything. All of these papers
can be downloaded and used normally (in fact, the authors are
hoping that's exactly what you do).

Because I think it must be stated: No, I am not the author of
any of these papers. (My own are at https://blogs.rividium.com
and I have plenty of them myself.) I am not granting any unauthorized
usage (plagiarism, copyright infringement, etc.); I'm simply
providing freely available papers as the authors intend them to
be provided: free with no silly access forms to provide information
to third-parties (I have one in mind, but that pary shall remain
nameless).

I hope you enjoy the papers!

Andy
